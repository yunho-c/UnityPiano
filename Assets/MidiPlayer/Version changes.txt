Please, before updating:
   - Backup your own project
   - If you get errors after updating, please quit Unity Editor and reload your project (GUID must be updated).
   - If you are updating from an older version and errors persist, delete the MidiPlayer folder from your project and reinstall Maestro.

Thank for your comments and talks, that help a lot to make Maestro better.

V2.15.0 2025-04-25
	New Features
		SoundFonts can be dynamically loaded either from a local file system or directly from the web.
        Supports assigning different SoundFonts to different MIDI players.
		Delays line number for reverb now can be expanded to 12 (default is 8) to produces a better quality sound but with a cpu cost. Add script symbols MPTK_REVERB_NBR_DELAYS_12 to expand.
		Changes the way each note-on velocity affects the attenuation of a voice. A higher value increases the volume at low velocity (the fluidsynth constant FLUID_PEAK_ATTENUATION is modified). Perfect for soundfont with not audible notes at low velocity. See member MPTK_VelocityAttenuation (experimental feature).
		Easier access to the verbose modes in the inspector.
		Access to MPTK custom ChatGPT from the About MPTK.
	Demo & MVP
		TestLoadingExternalSoundFont: use of the new MPTKSoundFont class (pro), predefined soundfonts, quick switching, ...
		MidiChannel: Free MVP, three simple demos in one! disable all channels but not drum, apply sustain, play extra notes ...
		HackYourMIDI: Pro MVP, how to transform a MIDI note-on on to an arppegio.
	Fix
		MPTK_LoadLiveSF is deprecated but is still working.
		Correct abrupt reverb off when any voice is active.
		Update from FS 2.3: ignore note-off for non looped samples in the attack phase and improve amp calculation.
		Improve MIDI sort and set priority for bank change (dramatically decrease time loading for big MIDI file).
		Ignore CC32 for LSB Bank change (default for GS soundfont))
		WebGL: subset generator for web, correct issue in GEN_STARTADDROFS, apply pitch at playing (Pitch Change). WebGL will be soon officialy available!
		Correct soundfont importing with truncated samples name. Can conduct to samples missing. It's a rare issue but in case of you need to re-import your specific soundfont.

V2.14.0 2024-12-22
	New Features
		Unlock global volume up to 10 (by default, limited to 1). Add script symbols MPTK_UNLOCK_VOLUME to unlock. Experimental, use with caution.
		Unlock MIDI player speed from 0.0001 to 100 (by default between to 0.1 and 10). Add script symbols MPTK_UNLOCK_SPEED to unlock. Experimental, use with caution.
		Add optionnal wait time to MPTK_Stop for waiting until MIDI is really stopped.
		Improve MPTK debug mode with MPTK_BuildInfoSynth.
		Move Maestro menu to Unity Tools menu when MPTK_MAESTRO_MENU_TOOLS symbol is defined.
		Soundfont caching is now optional when loading SF dynamically, see MidiPlayerGlobal.MPTK_LoadLiveSF. 
		Add MPTK_ResetTranspose to force cancel transpose when looping on a MIDI.
	Demo & MVP
		TestOboe: redesign (again!). Also good on non-Android devices for latency analysis.
		TestLoadingExternalSoundFont: redesign
		Create MVP demo MidiKeyboardThread
	Fix
		Correct Oboe setting to correct bad sound on some devices (buffer not a multiple of 64). 
		Correct MIDI thread reader with OnAudio callback to improve accuracy.
		Restore initial transpose value when looping.

V2.13.2 2024-10-31
	New Features
		Based on Unity version 2022.3

		TestOboe: UI redesign.

	Fixes
		Replace obsolete method in Unity 6.
		Correct synth attenuation range, limit to 1440.
		HelperDemo: replaced method LabelC4FromMidi with method LabelFromMidi. Now label centred in C4 (60 return C4). Removed LabelFromEcart method.
		MPTKWriter: Correct TickLast.
		Effect with oboe: process in blocks of 64 improve the quality.
		In folder MPTKGameObject/Pro, rename files MPTKEffect____.cs to MPTKEffect____Pro.cs. 
		In folder MPTKGameObject, create partial class MPTKEffect____.cs.
		Correct build error
		Correct transposition error
